# The Coders Guild Apprenticeship Tracker

Building a web app to track the progress of apprentices in the Coders Guild Apprenticeship.

This tracker is built using the following technologies:
- Vue.js front end
- Firebase for user authentication
- Monday.com for data storage (I have added some test data at the bottom of the correct board)

env file is currently in the repo for ease. To be taken out on production.

Run **npm run serve** to serve locally.

To update your tailwind output file, run **npm run build:tailwind**
